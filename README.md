This project serves as a base for every Framework Laptop 16 customer who wants to DIY their own vynil skin, without paying huge prices for pre-made skins.
The goal is to make an outline in a .svg or .pdf (vector graphics) format, so anyone can print the outline, put it over some cheap, raw vynil and cut out their skin, allowing for endless customization at a cheap price.
This project is done by myself only in my spare time, so be patient for updates. Any help is very much appreciated.
